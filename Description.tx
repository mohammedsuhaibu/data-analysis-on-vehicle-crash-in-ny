Objective: 
The datasets needed to be connected to be used all together.
- Step 1: Files were named the following PERSON_0NF.csv, VEHICLE_0NF.csv, CRASH_0NF.csv
- Step 2: Imported datasets into SQL
- Step 3: Filtered out varaibles needed and connect the tables together to create consolidated dataset

1. nycolpeople.sql

- Step 1: Table Creation (PERSON_1NF):
  - Created a table PERSON_1NF with essential person-related columns.
  - Mapped and filtered data from PERSON_0NF, excluding specific roles.

2. nycolvehicle.sql

- Step 2: Table Creation (VEHICLE_1NF):
  - Created a table VEHICLE_1NF with key vehicle-related columns.
  - Mapped values for PRIMARY_CONTRIBUTING_FACTOR based on conditions.
  - Filtered out records with null VEHICLE_CATEGORY.

3. nycolcrash.sql

- Step 3: Table Creation (CRASH_1NF):
  - Created a table CRASH_1NF with collision details.
  - Converted and filtered date and time data, limiting to the first 100 rows.

4. nycolnorm.sql

- Step 4: Table Creation (CRASH_2NF, VEHICLE_2NF, PERSON_2NF):
  - Created normalized tables by removing redundancy.
  - Added foreign key constraints between tables.
  - Copied data from previous tables into the new normalized ones.

5. nycolmerge.sql

- Step 5: Table Creation (CONSOLIDATED):
  - Created a table CONSOLIDATED by merging data from multiple tables.
  - Utilized LEFT JOIN to connect tables based on common identifiers.

6. INJURY_PER_COUNTY_BY_VEHICLE_CATEGORY.sql

- Step 6: Table Creation (INJURY_PER_COUNTY_BY_VEHICLE_CATEGORY):
  - Created a table showing injury counts per county and vehicle category.
  - Filtered out unspecified injuries and grouped data accordingly.

7. PERSON_INJURED_BY_SEX.sql

- Step 7: Table Creation (PERSON_INJURED_BY_SEX):
  - Created a table displaying counts of people injured or killed by sex and borough.
  - Used UNION to include a row for the grand total.
  - Filtered records based on injury status and sex.
