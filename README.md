In this comprehensive data analyst project, I engaged with diverse datasets sourced from NYC OPEN data, comprising CRASH, VEHICLE, PERSON, and VEHICLE TYPE TO CATEGORY records. The primary goal was to discern intrinsic road safety factors, identify the county with the highest incidence of crashes, and conduct meticulous temporal comparisons. The initiative aimed to foster public awareness and promote data-driven advocacy for enhanced road safety measures.

Data required thorough pre-processing, which involved consolidating four different datasets to enable comprehensive analysis. I skillfully utilized SQL to establish relationships between the datasets, ensuring data integrity with primary keys and optimizing performance.

During the data analysis phase, Excel was employed for in-depth exploration and insights. Advanced statistical techniques and data modeling identified trends and patterns in the datasets, efficiently managing large volumes of data. To present impactful findings, I utilized Tableau for dynamic and interactive visualizations, showcasing diverse charts and geographical maps to effectively communicate key insights. Validation and data reproducibility were ensured by recreating intricate Excel tables within the MySQL environment, demonstrating proficiency in data storage, retrieval, and advanced querying for rapid access to crucial information.

Insight: A substantial majority of primary contributing factors, approximately 59.72%, remain unspecified, underscoring the imperative for enhanced data collection practices. Addressing this critical issue requires the implementation of standardized reporting protocols, comprehensive training programs, incentivizing measures, and technological support to cultivate accurate and comprehensive datasets. Collaborative efforts and periodic data audits are essential in ensuring data integrity and providing essential insights to formulate effective road safety measures, thus safeguarding the well-being of the public.
